    <p>Sunt Lacrimae Rerum (2018). Digital video, 18 minutes 31 seconds.</p>
    <p>In a so-called Chilcot report, UK Parliament's public inquiry into the reasons leading to the Iraq war and it's legality. When a certain MI6 -officer, a specialist on the Middle Eastern affairs I believe informed the Blair governent on the threat posed by Iraq, was asked his views on Duelfer Report, ie. the official acknowledgement that Iraq posed no weapons of mass destruction therefore brignging into question the whole legality of the war, he answered simply: "Sunt lacrimae rerum".

    <p>The phrase is a famous quote from Aeneid by Vergilius. Largely considered to be untranslatable, it roughly means "these are the tears of things" in English. In the text the last hero of the fallen Troy Aeneas found himself as a refugee in today's Tunis, where Carthago, the Republican Rome's eternal enemy, is being built. Seeing a frieze commemorating the war and his fallen friends, he woes the tragedy of war, but rejoices in the compassion and humanity people feel towards those suffering, knowing he can seek refuge in the new city.</p>
    <p>The piece is a poetic investigation as a cinematic journal traversing several continents, cultures, historical epochs and literary text in a journey into one sentence, abstract, poetic and untranslatable, trying - perhaps in vain - to understand the moment of the very present.</p>
