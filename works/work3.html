    <p>Portrait (2025). GL -shaders program with Python generating a digital animation.</p>
    <p>Work is an on-going series of experimentations with OpenGL and GL -shaders. Here I took a wellknown presidential photograhp of John F. Kennedy combining it woth a recently revealed footage of his assasination.</p>
    <p>The pixels forming the area of his head are moved my the movement in the aforementioned footage. The process is automated and the movement is not controlled by me in any way, so whatever emerges is the interaction between this image of his prime and his fall.</p>
